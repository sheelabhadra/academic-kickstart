Howdy! I am a 1st year computer science PhD student at Texas A&M University. I am a part of the [Pi Star Lab](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/guni/pistar/research.html) headed by [Dr. Guni Sharon](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/guni/) where I work on developing reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous driving. My research focus is to build agents that can *perceive* their surroundings, *navigate* efficiently, and *act* safely.

I worked on image registration as part of my master's thesis. The title of my project was - “Automatic Whole-Brain Mapper for Localization and Registration” which I did under the guidance of [Dr. Zhangyang (Atlas) Wang](https://www.atlaswang.com/). During the course of the project, I developed an application for a neuroscience lab that optimized the manual process of counting neurons in rodent brain images. The application automatically processed the images and counted the neurons, reducing the time taken from 2-3 hours to under 15 minutes.
